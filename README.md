# Important! 

Website was designed with 90% zoom in mind :) Even though there is a meta tag for initial-scale, it may not work properly

# What is this all about?

This is the final project of the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS
Course

## General thoughts

- Goal
  - To practice grid as much as possible. Even if it is not fitting

It was a fun challenge to do all the stuff, where other methods of layout could
be easier.

I tried flexbox just once in this project, and it was much more intuitive to
use
than grid in that particular case (project cards).

Grid would require me to make explicit as possible. While flexbox does some
magic for you.

Grid kinda requires more fine-tuning if you want to make it look good, while
flexbox makes everything looks good out of the box. 

Using grid in not so appropriate situations gives makes a good practice
